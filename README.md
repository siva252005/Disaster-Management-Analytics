# 🌪️ Disaster Management Analytics Platform

> Analyzing historical disaster data to uncover vulnerability patterns, resource gaps, and risk trends across India — powered by Python, SQL, Power BI, and Streamlit.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Natural disasters cause massive loss of life and economic damage every year. This project aims to analyze historical disaster data to answer critical questions:

- Which states are most vulnerable to disasters?
- Which disaster types cause maximum deaths and economic loss?
- What are the trends over the years?
- How many people are affected on average?
- Which areas need more emergency resources?

## 🗺️ Project Phases

### 🟩 Phase 1 — Problem Understanding
- Define objectives and scope
- Identify key questions to answer
- Document technologies and approach

**Status:** ✅ Complete

---

### 🟨 Phase 2 — Dataset Collection
- Source historical disaster data from Kaggle
- Key columns: Year, State, District, Disaster Type, Deaths, Injured, Affected Population, Economic Loss

**Status:** ✅ Complete

---

### 🟦 Phase 3 — Data Cleaning
- Remove duplicates and handle missing values
- Standardize state names (e.g. `TN` → `Tamil Nadu`)
- Feature engineering: Severity levels, Decade grouping

**Status:** ✅ Complete

---

### 🟧 Phase 4 — Exploratory Data Analysis
- Most common disaster types (Bar chart)
- Year-wise trend (Line plot)
- Top affected states (Horizontal bar)
- Economic loss distribution (Pie chart)
- Correlation heatmap (Deaths vs Injured vs Affected Population)

**Status:**  ✅ Complete

---

### 🟥 Phase 5 — SQL Database & Analytics
- Create `disaster_db` MySQL database
- Import cleaned data
- Run analytical queries: top states, highest deaths, economic loss by state
